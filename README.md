# Price Predict using Linear Regression on The Ride-Hailing Platform
---
## Project Background
I am a data scientist who has a client who is the CEO of one of the largest companies in Boston. He often uses ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Lyft to support his high mobility. One day he felt that the fare for his trip was not the same even though the distance was the same. In this case, I was asked to predict his travel fares and find out what factors affect the travel fares to make it easier for him to manage his finances.

## About Dataset
This dataset contains detailed data of UBER & Lyft located in Boston from November 26, 2018 to December 18, 2018. This dataset contains of hour, day, month, distance, name, cab type, temperature, etc.

## Objective
This project aims to predict the price of rides on the ride-hailing platform of the company Uber &amp; Lyft in Boston, so we can know the price if we want to go to somewhere based on distance, hour, day, temperature, name (Uber or Lyft) and cab type.
